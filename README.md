## Build a Temperature Conversion Program

## Problem Statement: 
Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

## Solution
#### User Input:
Asks the user to input a temperature value (temp) and the original unit of measurement (unit), which can be Celsius ('C' or 'c'), Fahrenheit ('F' or 'f'), or Kelvin ('K' or 'k').

#### Temperature Conversion:
Uses a switch statement to determine the conversion based on the input unit.
Converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user.
Conversion Formulas:

#### Output:
Prints the converted temperature values with appropriate units (Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin) based on user input.

#### Error Handling:
Handles invalid unit input by displaying an error message.
